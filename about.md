The purpose of this application is to estimate the probability of surviving
the Titanic catastrophe. Historical data of the accident is used in order
to estimate a logistic regression model that calculates the probabilities with respect to several variables. 

For each person on board the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner
Titanic, the underlying dataset records sex, age [adult/child], economic status
[first/second/third class or crew] and whether or not that person
survived.

With this application, everyone can evaluate how likely they would have
survived this fatal event, should they have been on board.

Instructions:
* Please choose of the economic status options (1st, 2nd, 3rd class or crew)
* Choose your sex
* Choose your age
* Press the "Calculate your chance of surviving!" button.
* Your selection will appear on the right-hand side. You will find the relevant percentage
statistics right below.
* An error message will appear whenever you pick Crew class and Child age - children do not work aboard.
